## :wave: Hi there, I'm Oscar aka sccreeper

I mostly program using Python, but recently I have started to pick up C# for projects that require a bit more performance.

### :pencil2: I am currently working on:

 - :pencil: [image2excel](https://github.com/sccreeper/image2excel), a program that converts images to Excel spreadsheets.

 - :robot: [pibot](https://github.com/sccreeper/pibot), software for the Raspberry PI which should make making basic robots easier.
